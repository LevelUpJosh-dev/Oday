            primary: This project started as a way to learn about this new technology I had heard about, called Deno.
                     From there, my fascination with the runtime grew into a drive to create and see what was possible using Deno as my base runtime. After a couple weeks of using it,
                     I found that I had created an effective architecture for developing and deploying a viable static site using nothing but Deno, Deno Deploy, and Bootstrap.
                     Bootstrap is a simple link included via the Bootstrap cached package on jsDelivr. If you don't want to use Bootstrap, the link can simply be removed from the Html due to how Deno handles modules and dependencies in deno. So these could be replaced or removed entirely depending on your needs.
                     From there, I decided to pare back what I had written for my own site into a static package allowing anyone to spin up a global website or app in about half an hour using Deno. I hope you enjoy the project. It does not claim to be anything more than a passion project. Check me out on GitHub or Twitter for more information.

        content:
            primary: Oday is a small, fast JS framework built on Deno. It quickly allows you to deploy an extremely performant website using Deno and Deno deploy. 
                     It uses Bootstrap 5 as a toolkit for creating templates and consistent experiences using class-based styling. 
                     Once you use the template, you are free to use whatever modules can be included in Deno proper and some cross Deno/Browser modules. 
                     Currently, Bootstrap is the only dependency in the project. Because of the nature of Deno's dependency management, simply removing the Bootstrap inclusion is all that is required to remove this dependency. 
                     Due to the nature of Oday, you could just remove that entry in the Oday.YAML data modal or toggle Resource enable flag. More on this later.
            secondary: This has been in development for all of 2-3 weeks, I plan to use it to build out some of my own personal projects. That said if you have an interest 
                       and want to fork this template and try it out you'll find all the info you need in the Oday GitHub repository.

            secondary: I am a full stack software engineer and JavaScript lover. I currently spend my days writing code and
                       collaborating with all the amazing folks at The Red Van Workshop. I am happy to talk code, star wars or movies.
                       I look to learn something new everyday and I aim to make people laugh. If you interested in me
                       or my projects feel free to follow me on Twitter or GitHub.

            primary: Deno is a modern runtime built to run JavaScript and Typescript, it was developed to mirror many of the browser concepts. 
                     this creates a sense or parity between browser and server-side development. It has a focus on performance and security, 
                     Deno limits the access your code has to core systems unless permission is given otherwise. This protects systems that have no need to be exposed for the current project. 
                     For example Deno is not allowed to access the filesystem (reading or writing files) unless the permissions is explicitly given.
            secondary: The second piece that drives Deno even further forward is in my mind. Is Deno Deploy, Deno Deploy is a modern scaling JavaScript runtime developed for Deno. It allows you to deploy your Deno applications to the edge of the web
                       globally using only a GitHub repository with your Deno project and one page of simple configuration in your Deno Deploy dashboard. Ok, so that sounds pretty cool; how much does it cost? 
                       So here is the craziest part it's free! While there is a pro account which I happily pay for, the free version has more than enough bang to run an excellent production-level application.
