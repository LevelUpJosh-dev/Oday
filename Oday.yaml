        content:
            primary: This project started as a way to learn about this new technology I had heard about, called Deno.
                     From there, my fascination with the runtime grew into a drive to create and see what was possible using Deno as my base runtime. After a couple weeks of using it,
                     I found that I had created an effective architecture for developing and deploying a viable static site using nothing but Deno, Deno Deploy, and Bootstrap.
                     Bootstrap is a simple link included via the Bootstrap cached package on jsDelivr. If you don't want to use Bootstrap, the link can simply be removed from the Html due to how Deno handles modules and dependencies in deno. So these could be replaced or removed entirely depending on your needs.
                     From there, I decided to pare back what I had written for my own site into a static package allowing anyone to spin up a global website or app in about half an hour using Deno. I hope you enjoy the project. It does not claim to be anything more than a passion project. Check me out on GitHub or Twitter for more information.

        content:
            primary: Build a site using a Yaml-defined data structure allowing you to manage and modify the look and feel of your site with simple Key, Value inputs in a clean data modal. This feature is currently still in development; Oday now supports Elements, Classes, IDs, and Content for all out-of-the-box templates and partials within the data modal.
                     Extending the data modal is as simple as adding the Keys and Values to your Oday.yaml and deconstructing those parsed modules in your template module. From there, you can utilize your data values as needed.
            secondary: This template is, at its core, a passion project built from my desire to master JavaScript. 
                       Oday aims to be a simplistic, highly performant foundation for any web project you think might be interesting. 
                       In service to this goal, I work everyday to master new skills and refine my skill set nothing else this project has helped me become and even better developer.

DenoInfo:
    id: oday-deno-info

    Main:
        classes: px-4 mx-auto w-75
        id: oday-deno-info-main
        content:
            primary: Deno is a modern runtime which can run both JavaScript and Typescript natively, it was developed heavily with the V8 runtime in mind. To create a sense or parity between browser and server-side development.
                     It has a focus on performance and security, Deno limits the access your code has to core systems unless permission is given otherwise. This protects systems that have no need to be exposed for the current project. 
                     For example Deno is not allowed to access the filesystem (reading or writing files) unless the permissions is explicitly given.
            secondary: The second piece that drives Deno even further forward is in my mind. Is Deno Deploy, Deno Deploy is a modern scaling JavaScript runtime developed for Deno. It allows you to deploy your Deno applications to the edge of the web
                       globally using only a GitHub repository with your Deno project and one page of simple configuration in your Deno Deploy dashboard. Ok, so that sounds pretty cool; how much does it cost? 
                       So here is the craziest part it's free! While there is a pro account which I happily pay for, the free version has more than enough bang to run an excellent production-level application.
